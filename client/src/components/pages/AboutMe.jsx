				Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio (/diˈkæprioʊ, dɪ-/; Italian: [diˈkaːprjo];
				born November 11, 1974) is an American actor and film producer. Known
				for his work in biographical and period films, he is the recipient of
				numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film
				Award, and three Golden Globe Awards. As of 2019, his films have grossed
				over $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has been placed eight times in
				annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors. Born in Los Angeles,
				DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television
				commercials. In the early 1990s, he had recurring roles in various
				television shows, such as the sitcom Parenthood, and had his first major
				film part as author Tobias Wolff in This Boy's Life (1993). He received
				critical acclaim and his first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award
				nominations for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy in
				What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). DiCaprio achieved international
				stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic
				(1997). After the latter became the highest-grossing film in the world
				at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to
				shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other
				genres, including the 2002 crime dramas Catch Me If You Can and Gangs of
				New York; the latter marked the first of his many successful
				collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.
